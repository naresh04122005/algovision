# AlgoVision – AI‑Powered Coding Assistant

**A full-stack project that combines Gemini API with algorithmic expertise to help developers solve DSA challenges.**

---

## Overview

AlgoVision is a web-based coding assistant that:
- Classifies problem statements (e.g., “graph shortest path,” “knapsack DP”) using the **Gemini API**
- Matches them to best-fit **data structure & algorithm implementations** (Graph, DP, Greedy, etc.)
- Displays interactive **template code snippets** and explanations
- Deployed on **Google Cloud**, ready for multiple concurrent users

---

## Features

- **Problem Classification**  
  Uses Gemini to determine problem type with ~92% accuracy

- **Algorithm Template Library**  
  Contains 15+ ready-to-use algorithm snippets in Python

- **Web Interface**  
  Built with FastAPI (backend) and optional React frontend

- **Analytics Tracking**  
  Logs classification accuracy and usage stats

- **Scalable Deployment**  
  Hosted on Google Cloud Run for 100+ concurrent users
